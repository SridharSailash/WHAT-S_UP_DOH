Bt_Root

firstly i opened this file using wireshark and then saw many random packets . i scrolled down and then found one packet which was unique and different format from the others andonce i opened this gattacker which was in  txt format i saw some text in {onsite} and tried it but was not the answer . then there was also text written stating all hail king bluetooth. that was not the flag as it was incorrect then i searced it in google and got the name harald bluetooth . it was the answer.
